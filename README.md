## Test Overview

For testing purposes, I have used the canary token to generate a test URL generating requests

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akito7011/IDS-with-docker.git
   cd IDS-with-docker
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following environment variable:
     ```plaintext
     SERVER_URL=your_server_url_here
     ```

## Usage

1. **Configure the IDS:**
   - Edit the `config.py` file to set your network interface and log file.

2. **Run the IDS:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through the `config.py` file and `.env` file.

- `config.py`:
  ```python
  import os
  from dotenv import load_dotenv
  import netifaces

  load_dotenv()

  SERVER_URL = os.getenv('SERVER_URL')
  INTERFACE = "\\Device\\NPF_" + str(netifaces.gateways()['default'][netifaces.AF_INET][1])
  LOG_FILE = 'ids.log'
  ```
  - `SERVER_URL`: URL of the server to report suspicious activities.
  - `INTERFACE`: Network interface to capture packets.
  - `LOG_FILE`: File to log suspicious activities.

## File Descriptions

- **config.py**: Configuration file that loads environment variables and sets network interface and log file.

- **main.py**: Entry point of the IDS. Initializes and starts packet capture.

- **packet_processing.py**: Contains the `IDS` class responsible for packet capture, filtering, and analysis.

- **server_communication.py**: Handles communication with the remote server. Defines `Packet` and `ServerCall` classes.

- **suspiciousActivity.py**: Contains functions to check for suspicious activities, unusual ports, unusual traffic, protocol violations, and failed connections.

- **utils.py**: Utility functions. Currently includes a function to check if an IP address is private.
